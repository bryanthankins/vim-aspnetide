INTRODUCTION                                    *aspnetide-intro*

This plugin allows you to easily edit ASP.NET applications with vim. It attempts to give you some of the niceties you may be used to from a full IDE without getting in your way like a full IDE.

aspnetide defines the following commands:

|:ASPDoc|
|:ASPBuild|
|:ASPAltFile|
|:ASPRun|
|:ASPGoTo|

:ASPDoc                                         *:ASPDoc*
   Jump to online help based on selected word: F1 or <leader>H

:ASPBuild                                       *:ASPBuild*
   Find a solution file for the project and build. Errors shown in quickfix. Function mapped to <leader>B

:ASPAltFile                                     *:ASPAltFile*
   Navigate to alternate files (ASPX <-> code-behind). Function mapped to <leader>A

:ASPRun                                         *:ASPRun*
   Run app in local webserver and navigate to selected page. Function mapped
   to F5 or <leader>R

:ASPGoTo                                        *:ASPGoTo*
   Takes you to the class file based on the current word. So if you are on "Utility" it will look through the directory tree for the utility class file.
